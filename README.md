##What's this?

This is a small helper for me to translate Rubberduck. 

##Why?

- Manual XML editing is a royal PITA
- I want to do some XML parsing.. it seems to be hard
- I wanted to learn some gradle, MVP, maybe use travis

##What does it do?

Right now? not all that much. You can check out what's in my queue 
in the ["Backlog"](https://github.com/Vogel612/TranslationHelper/wiki/"Backlog")

Also for any possible bugs I still need to squash and features I'm currently working on,
check the [issues](https://github.com/Vogel612/TranslationHelper/issues)
