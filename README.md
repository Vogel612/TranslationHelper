##What's this?

This is a small helper for me to translate Rubberduck. 

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/Vogel612/TranslationHelper/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)]
(https://coveralls.io/github/Vogel612/TranslationHelper?branch=master)

##Why?

- Manual XML editing is a royal PITA
- I want to do some XML parsing.. it seems to be hard
- I wanted to learn some gradle, MVP, maybe use travis

##What does it do?

Right now? Right now I am able to edit translations in the RubberduckUI.de.resx file.
The first milestone is already reached and now I'm about to clear out additional locales and 
general UX improvements.

For any possible bugs I still need to squash and features I'm currently working on,
check the [issues](https://github.com/Vogel612/TranslationHelper/issues)

For the things that are yet to come...I have my ["Backlog"](https://github.com/Vogel612/TranslationHelper/wiki/"Backlog")
